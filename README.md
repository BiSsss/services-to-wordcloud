* Fonts are taken from the various of places and initially distributed by the authors under one of the open licenses. A huge collection of fonts can be found in the [googlefontdirectory github repository](https://github.com/w0ng/googlefontdirectory).

### Installation
Use 'pip' to install dependencies
```
pip instal matplotlib
pip install twitter 
pip intall pyprind
pip install numpy
pip isntall matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip isntall scipy
```
Or use 'conda' from Anaconda to install dependencies (*better solutions in case you are new to python or Windows user*):
```
conda instal matplotlib
conda install twitter 
conda intall pyprind
conda install numpy
conda isntall matplotlib
conda install pandas
conda isntall scipy
```

Installing [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) package can be very tricky
```
pip install git+git://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git
conda install pil
```
